                            <p>Start small! Your first game should be simple and achievable. Many successful developers started with small projects like Pong or Breakout clones. Focus on completing a game rather than creating the perfect game. Iteration and finishing projects is more valuable than starting ambitious projects you never complete.</p>

                            <p>Always use version control, even for solo projects. It's a lifesaver when you break something. Use LTS versions of Unity for stability. Keep your project organized with clear folder structure. Set up your IDE properly - good autocomplete and debugging will save hours.</p>

Network at game dev events and online communities. Learn continuously - the industry changes fast. Consider starting indie to learn all aspects, then specialize if desired.
